# [üéµ Shrudio: Your Ultimate Audio Lab](https://shrudio-by-shreyash.vercel.app/)

**Author: Shreyash Srivastva**

## Shrudio is your all-in-one audio tool: play music, generate melodies, create sound effects, and tune instruments‚Äîall in a sleek, intuitive interface powered by the Web Audio API. üé∂‚ú® 

## Inspiration
Shrudio was inspired by the desire to create an all-in-one audio tool that allows musicians, creators, and sound enthusiasts to generate, play, and experiment with different audio features in a seamless environment. We wanted to bring together the power of music creation, sound effects, and real-time pitch detection into one platform.

## What it does
Shrudio is a versatile audio application offering four main features:
- **Music Player**: Upload and play local audio files with intuitive controls.
- **Music Generator**: Create melodies by customizing scale, tempo, octave, and instrument.
- **Sound Effects**: Play a variety of sound effects like laser, explosion, and power-up instantly.
- **Tuner**: Tune your instrument in real-time using your microphone for pitch and note detection.

## How we built it
Shrudio was developed using:
- **Frontend**: React and TypeScript to create a dynamic and responsive interface.
- **Audio API**: The Web Audio API powers all audio functionalities, enabling sound manipulation and real-time tuning.
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS was used to build a clean and minimalist design that provides a smooth user experience.

---

## Challenges we ran into
- Integrating real-time audio manipulation with the Web Audio API required deep understanding and careful implementation to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Handling various audio formats in the music player and ensuring compatibility across devices posed some challenges.
- Fine-tuning the pitch detection algorithm for the tuner was tricky, but we managed to get it working accurately.

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully integrating multiple audio features into one platform, allowing users to seamlessly generate, play, and explore sounds.
- Creating an easy-to-use and aesthetically pleasing interface that enhances user experience.
- Building a functional real-time pitch tuner that works across a variety of instruments.

---

## What we learned
- The Web Audio API is incredibly powerful but requires careful management of resources for smooth performance.
- Tailwind CSS significantly streamlines UI development, enabling rapid design iteration without sacrificing quality.
- Fine-tuning real-time features like pitch detection can be more complex than expected, but it‚Äôs immensely rewarding when it works.

---

## What's next for Shrudio
- Implementing additional sound effects and audio manipulation tools.
- Adding a cloud sync feature for music files, enabling users to access their audio library across devices.
- Enhancing the music generator with more customizable features, like advanced harmony and rhythm options.
- Expanding the tuner to support more instruments and provide additional tuning modes.
